# MachineLearningEDLC
This project is a Machine Learning application of Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors(EDLCs) also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors

Project repertory consists of codes in Python and Matlab

Deep Neural Networks are utilized in Python in order to build a model for the performance (gravimetric capacity, energy density, power density) prediciton of EDLCs

Regression trees are utilized in Matlab to investigate key parameters effcting the perfromance of EDLCs
